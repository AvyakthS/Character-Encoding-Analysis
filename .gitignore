# 1. Default behaviour does NOT ignore User Datasets
# To ignore User Datasets (but keep the folder structure), uncomment the following line.
#user_bench_files_freesize/*
!user_bench_files_freesize/.gitkeep

# 2. Ignore Standardized Generated Datasets
user_bench_files_standardized/*
!user_bench_files_standardized/.gitkeep

# 3. Uncomment the desired lines to ignore Benchmark Results, Graphs & Logs inside version folders
# (Assuming you want to keep the scripts, but not the CSVs/Reports generated by runs)
#versions/**/*.csv
#versions/**/*.txt
#versions/**/*.png
versions/**/test_output.*

# 4. Ignore Python Cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
