!user_bench_files_freesize/.gitkeep

# 2. Ignore Standardized Generated Datasets

!user_bench_files_standardized/.gitkeep

# 3. Ignore Benchmark Results & Logs inside version folders (generated charts are not ignored for the purpose of inclusion in the README; uncomment the line to change the default behaviour)
